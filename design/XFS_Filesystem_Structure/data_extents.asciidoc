[[Data_Extents]]
= Data Extents

XFS allocates space for a file using extents: starting location and length. XFS
extents also specify the file's logical starting offset for a file. This allows
a files extent map to automatically support sparse files (i.e. "holes" in the
file). A flag is also used to specify if the extent has been preallocated and
not yet been written to (unwritten extent).

A file can have more than one extent if one chunk of contiguous disk space is
not available for the file. As a file grows, the XFS space allocator will
attempt to keep space contiguous and merge extents. If more than one file is
being allocated space in the same AG at the same time, multiple extents for the
files will occur as the extents get interleaved. The effect of this can vary
depending on the extent allocator used in the XFS driver.

An extent is 128 bits in size and uses the following packed layout:

.Extent record format
image::images/31.png[]

The extent is represented by the +xfs_bmbt_rec+ structure which uses a big
endian format on-disk. In-core management of extents use the +xfs_bmbt_irec+
structure which is the unpacked version of +xfs_bmbt_rec+:

[source, c]
----
struct xfs_bmbt_irec {
     xfs_fileoff_t             br_startoff;
     xfs_fsblock_t             br_startblock;
     xfs_filblks_t             br_blockcount;
     xfs_exntst_t              br_state;
};
----



The extent +br_state+ field uses the following enum declaration:

[source, c]
----
typedef enum {
     XFS_EXT_NORM,
     XFS_EXT_UNWRITTEN,
     XFS_EXT_INVALID
} xfs_exntst_t;
----

Some other points about extents:

* The +xfs_bmbt_rec_32_t+ and +xfs_bmbt_rec_64_t+ structures are effectively
the same as +xfs_bmbt_rec_t+, just different representations of the same 128
bits in on-disk big endian format.

* When a file is created and written to, XFS will endeavour to keep the extents
within the same AG as the inode. It may use a different AG if the AG is busy
or there is no space left in it.

* If a file is zero bytes long, it will have no extents, +di_nblocks+ and
+di_nexents+ will be zero. Any file with data will have at least one extent, and
each extent can use from 1 to over 2 million blocks (2^21^) on the filesystem.
For a default 4KB block size filesystem, a single extent can be up to 8GB in
length.

The following two subsections cover the two methods of storing extent
information for a file. The first is the fastest and simplest where the inode
completely contains an extent array to the file's data. The second is slower and
more complex B+tree which can handle thousands to millions of extents
efficiently.


[[Extent_List]]
== Extent List

Local extents are where the entire extent array is stored within the inode's
data fork itself. This is the most optimal in terms of speed and resource
consumption. The trade-off is the file can only have a few extents before the
inode runs out of space.

The "data fork" of the inode contains an array of extents, the size of the array
determined by the inode's +di_nextents+ value.

image::images/32.png[]

The number of extents that can fit in the inode depends on the inode size and
+di_forkoff+. For a default 256 byte inode with no extended attributes, a file
can up to 19 extents with this format. Beyond this, extents have to use the
B+tree format.

We can expand the highlighted section into the following bit array from MSB to
LSB with the file offset and the block count highlighted:

 31-0 :  0101 1000 111**0 0000  0000 0111 1110 1001**

Grouping by highlights we get:
   file offset = 0x0fd2 (4050)
   start block = 0x7ac7 (31431)
   block count = 0x07e9 (2025)

[[Btree_Extent_List]]
== B+tree Extent List

Beyond the simple extent array, to efficiently manage large extent maps, XFS
uses B+trees. The root node of the B+tree is stored in the inode's data fork.
All block pointers for extent B+trees are 64-bit absolute block numbers.

For a single level B+tree, the root node points to the B+tree's leaves. Each
leaf occupies one filesystem block and contains a header and an array of extents
sorted by the file's offset. Each leaf has left and right (or backward and
forward) block pointers to adjacent leaves. For a standard 4KB filesystem block,
a leaf can contain up to 254 extents before a B+tree rebalance is triggered.

For a multi-level B+tree, the root node points to other B+tree nodes which
eventually point to the extent leaves. B+tree keys are based on the file's
offset. The nodes at each level in the B+tree point to the adjacent nodes.

The base B+tree node is used for extents, directories and extended attributes.
The structures used for inode's B+tree root are:

[source, c]
----
struct xfs_bmdr_block {
     __be16                     bb_level;
     __be16                     bb_numrecs;
};
struct xfs_bmbt_key {
     xfs_fileoff_t              br_startoff;
};
typedef xfs_fsblock_t xfs_bmbt_ptr_t, xfs_bmdr_ptr_t;
----

* On disk, the B+tree node starts with the +xfs_bmbr_block_t+ header followed by
an array of +xfs_bmbt_key_t+ values and then an array of +xfs_bmbt_ptr_t+
values. The size of both arrays is specified by the header's +bb_numrecs+ value.

* The root node in the inode can only contain up to 19 key/pointer pairs for a
standard 256 byte inode before a new level of nodes is added between the root
and the leaves. This will be less if +di_forkoff+ is not zero (i.e. attributes
are in use on the inode).

The subsequent nodes and leaves of the B+tree use the +xfs_btree_lblock+
declaration:

[source, c]
----
struct xfs_btree_lblock {
     __be32                    bb_magic;
     __be16                    bb_level;
     __be16                    bb_numrecs;
     __be64                    bb_leftsib;
     __be64                    bb_rightsib;
};
----

* For intermediate nodes, the data following +xfs_btree_lblock+ is the same as
the root node: array of +xfs_bmbt_key+ value followed by an array of
+xfs_bmbt_ptr_t+ values that starts halfway through the block (offset 0x808 for
a 4096 byte filesystem block).

* For leaves, an array of +xfs_bmbt_rec+ extents follow the +xfs_btree_lblock+
header.

* Nodes and leaves use the same value for +bb_magic+: 

[source, c]
#define XFS_BMAP_MAGIC		0x424d4150	/* 'BMAP' */

* The +bb_level+ value determines if the node is an intermediate node or a leaf.
Leaves have a +bb_level+ of zero, nodes are one or greater.

* Intermediate nodes, like leaves, can contain up to 254 pointers to leaf blocks
for a standard 4KB filesystem block size as both the keys and pointers are 64
bits in size.
